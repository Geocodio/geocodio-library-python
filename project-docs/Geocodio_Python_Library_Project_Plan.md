- Review Geocodio PHP client library
- Review pygeocodio (third-party Python library)
- Review Geocodio API documentation
- Review and extract endpoint schema from OpenAPI spec
- Draft proposed Python class structure and method signatures
- Review and revise initial plan internally
- Finalize internal API specification (doc format)
- **Deliverable:** API specification document

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Sync) (2025-04-30 to 2025-05-13)
- Implement forward geocoding (single address)
- Implement forward geocoding (batch)
- Implement reverse geocoding (single coordinate)
- Implement reverse geocoding (batch)
- Implement address parsing interface and response mapping
- Implement data append options (timezone, districts, etc.)
- Handle request construction and response parsing
- Add input validation for all user-facing methods
- Format API responses into Python data classes or dicts
- Code review and refactor for clarity and maintainability
- **Deliverable:** Working synchronous Python library

### Phase 3: Enhancements & Validation (2025-05-14 to 2025-05-19)
- Implement exception classes and error raising for 4xx/5xx
- Log errors and request metadata for debugging (opt-in)
- Add environment/config support for setting API key
- Perform internal QA on inputs/outputs and expected behavior
- **Deliverable:** Enhanced and validated library

### Phase 4: Testing (2025-05-20 to 2025-05-27)
- Write unit tests for geocoding functions
- Write unit tests for parsing and appending functions
- Write integration tests using the Geocodio API (live key)
- Mock API for offline test coverage
- Review and improve test coverage (target ~90%)
- **Deliverable:** Fully tested library

### Phase 5: CI/CD & PyPI Publishing (2025-05-28 to 2025-06-04)
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated test runs on PR
- Create setup.py and/or pyproject.toml
- Configure PyPI publishing workflow (via GitHub or manual)
- Draft minimal README with installation and quick usage
- Run manual test release to PyPI test instance
- Publish v1.0 to PyPI
- **Deliverable:** Published Python package

---

## üéØ Key Benefits

- **Reliability:** Clear and automated management of API rate limits and error conditions, reducing developer overhead and manual intervention.
- **Ease of Integration:** Documentation aligned directly with Geocodio's existing library documentation for consistency and ease of use.
- **Simplified Ongoing Maintenance:** Automated testing and publishing workflows streamline updates and ensure ongoing library health with minimal effort.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- Complete Python library feature-equivalent to the official PHP library.
- Robust synchronous client implementation.
- Automated CI/CD setup for ongoing ease of maintenance and deployment.

---

## üìå Next Steps
- Confirm and approve the API design (Phase 1).
- Begin core feature development (Phase 2).

Please let us know if you have any questions or require further details.
