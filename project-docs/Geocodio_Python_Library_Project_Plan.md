## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks by Phase

### Phase 1: Research & Design
- Review existing Geocodio libraries and official API.
- Create detailed API design ensuring feature parity with the PHP client.
- **Deliverable:** API specification document.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Sync)
- Implement synchronous methods: forward/reverse geocoding, batch processing, address parsing, data appending.
- **Deliverable:** Working synchronous Python library.

### Phase 3: Async Implementation
- Implement asynchronous support using Python's asyncio and aiohttp libraries, enabling concurrent requests for improved performance.

**Example:**
```python
from geocodio import AsyncGeocodioClient

async def geocode_addresses(addresses):
    client = AsyncGeocodioClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
    results = await client.batch_geocode(addresses)
    return results
```

- **Deliverable:** Functional async capabilities alongside synchronous methods.

### Phase 4: Improvements & Robustness
- Implement precise rate limit handling with exponential backoff.

**Example:**
If a request exceeds the API limit, the library automatically retries after incremental delays (e.g., 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds).

- Enhance error handling, logging clarity, and overall stability.
- **Deliverable:** Robust, reliable library with clear error reporting.

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Create detailed user documentation and examples, provided in the format requested by Geocodio to seamlessly integrate with current library documentation.
- **Deliverable:** Fully tested and documented library.

### Phase 6: Automation & Publishing
- Configure automated testing and publishing workflows matching the official PHP client's CI/CD practices.
- **Deliverable:** Official Python library published to PyPI.

## üéØ Key Benefits

- **Async Support:** Enables users to handle multiple geocoding requests concurrently, significantly boosting throughput and application responsiveness.
- **Reliability:** Clear and automated management of API rate limits and error conditions, reducing developer overhead and manual intervention.
- **Ease of Integration:** Documentation aligned directly with Geocodio's existing library documentation for consistency and ease of use.
- **Simplified Ongoing Maintenance:** Automated testing and publishing workflows streamline updates and ensure ongoing library health with minimal effort.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- Complete Python library feature-equivalent to the official PHP library.
- Robust synchronous and asynchronous client implementations.
- Comprehensive rate-limit handling, error management, and clear logging.
- Fully integrated user documentation matching Geocodio's documentation standards.
- Automated CI/CD setup for ongoing ease of maintenance and deployment.

---

## üìå Next Steps
- Confirm and approve the API design (Phase 1).
- Begin core feature development (Phase 2).

Please let us know if you have any questions or require further details.
