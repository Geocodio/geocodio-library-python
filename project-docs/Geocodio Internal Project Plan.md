# Geocodio Python Library Internal Project Plan 🌟

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to our journey of building something awesome together! This plan is designed to be your friendly guide through the development of the Geocodio Python Library. We've built in plenty of breathing room and celebration points along the way. Remember: progress, not perfection! 🎯

## ⏰ Time Management Quick Reference ⏰

### Daily Time Blocks
```
🕚 11:00 - 12:30 | Morning Focus
🕧 12:30 - 13:00 | Break & Refresh
🕐 13:00 - 14:30 | Afternoon Sprint
🕝 14:30 - 15:00 | Break & Stretch
🕒 15:00 - 16:30 | Final Push
🕟 16:30 - 17:00 | Wrap-up & Plan Tomorrow
```

### Pomodoro Technique 🍅
```
25 min work → 5 min break → 25 min work → 5 min break
25 min work → 5 min break → 25 min work → 15 min break
Repeat!
```

## Managing Perfectionism & Procrastination 🧠

### Quick Tips for Success
- **Done is better than perfect** - Your first version doesn't need to be perfect
- **Small wins matter** - Celebrate completing even small tasks
- **Progress over perfection** - Every step forward is valuable
- **Break it down** - Large tasks are just many small tasks in sequence
- **Start anywhere** - You don't need to start at the beginning

### Daily Strategies
1. **Morning Kickstart** 🌅
   - Start with the easiest task to build momentum
   - Set a timer for 25 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
   - Take a 5-minute break after each session

2. **Progress Tracking** 📈
   - Focus on what you've accomplished, not what's left
   - Celebrate small wins daily
   - Remember: 80% done is better than 0% perfect

3. **When You Feel Stuck** 🤔
   - Take a short walk or stretch break
   - Work on a different task for a while
   - Ask for help - it's okay to collaborate!
